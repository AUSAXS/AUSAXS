Implement the hydration algorithm. 
	- Ray-tracing placement of water molecules
	- Change collision_checker from nlogn to const in grid size
	- consider how to improve culling method
	- Calculate volume based on aminosyrer (the sequence letters in pymol)
	- Test it on a bunch of different .pdb files (6YG9)

Grid:
	- Consider simply calculating and using the bounding box at initialization as the entire grid instead of wasting memory

HETATM records:
	- How do we handle non-water atoms when calculating distances, hydration layer, ...
	- Currently TER records are broken in PDB_file and will be inserted in the middle of the HETATM records

Bundle all dependencies to make them easier to install
    - ROOT, Boost
    - Consider if ROOT is really necessary

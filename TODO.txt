Implement the hydration algorithm. 
	- consider how to improve culling method
	- Test it on a bunch of different .pdb files (6YG9)

Grid:
	- Consider simply calculating and using the bounding box at initialization as the entire grid instead of wasting memory

Slices:
	- Instead of operating on *Matrix, it should operator on its &vector data to avoid dereferencing

Bundle all dependencies to make them easier to install
    - ROOT, Boost
    - Consider if ROOT is really necessary

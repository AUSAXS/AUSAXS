[] Fix excessive calls to get_histogram in Sequencer (see log)
[] There's something fishy about how transformations are currently being applied. Previously, we used to first translate -cm, rotate, then translate +cm. This was removed in favor of a simpler system where all template bodies are pre-centered, such that we can now do rotate, translate cm+t. But this appears to be inconsistent with the previous approach, probably due to how SingleTransform or RigidTransform applies a single translation to *all* connected bodies, which would invalidate the current separation of cm.

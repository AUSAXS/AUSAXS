# Todo
	* [ ] SLICES: change *Matrix pointers to &vector<double> for better efficiency
	* [ ] ATOM: Const uid 
	* [ ] CONSTANTS: Rethink how to determine charge densities for arbitrary ligands

# Stuff to consider
## Grid:
	* Consider simply calculating and using the bounding box at initialization as the entire grid instead of wasting memory
	* Consider changing how it stores its atom data
	* Consider how to improve culling method

# Dependencies
Maybe bundle them somehow to make it easier to install?
    * ROOT
    * Boost

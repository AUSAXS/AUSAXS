Todo:
	- [] SLICES: change *Matrix pointers to &vector<double> for better efficiency
	- [] ATOM: Const uid 
	- [] CONSTANTS: Rethink how to determine charge densities for arbitrary ligands

Grid:
	- Consider simply calculating and using the bounding box at initialization as the entire grid instead of wasting memory
	- Consider changing how it stores its atom data
	- Consider how to improve culling method

Bundle all dependencies to make them easier to install
    - ROOT, Boost
    - Consider if ROOT is really necessary

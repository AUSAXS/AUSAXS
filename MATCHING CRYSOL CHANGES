Remove scaling factor of pi^2 from excluded volume exponentials
Use excluded volume measurements by Fraser, Suzuki, & McRae for the Hx, Cx, Nx, Ox form factors
#Switch around the displaced volume of NH2 and NH
Divided excluded volume form factors by 2
Added if-case to CompactCoordinatesFF for "N" atom names to return atom_group_t::NH

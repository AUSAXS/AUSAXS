AUSAXS is split into several subprojects to reduce interdependencies. These will be compiled as individual 

`core`: the basic functionality common to all applications. 
`crystal`: crystal scattering calculations. These are currently unused.
`em`: classes related to electron-microscopy validation.
`gui`: helper-files for the GUI executables. 
`math`: a standalone math library used in all areas of AUSAXS. 
`rigidbody`: files required for rigidbody optimization.
